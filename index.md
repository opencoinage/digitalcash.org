What is digital cash?
---------------------

Also known as digital currency, digital money, e-cash, e-currency, or
e-money, digital cash refers to a unique cryptographic string of digits
representing value that can be transferred electronically. In its purest
form, digital cash emulates the features of physical paper currency, namely
anonymity and untraceability. Additionally, digital cash may include other
features such as expiration dates, irreversibility, re-issuance, and
variable denomination amounts.

In addition to competing protocols, digital cash issuers compete on the
basis of brand recognition, trustworthiness, user-friendly e-wallets,
multiple hardware devices, jurisdictional independence, and most
importantly, reserve value backing. Although digital cash issuers may
choose any commodity or political fiat currency as their reserve value
backing, market forces ultimately will determine the winners and losers.

The direct benefits of digital cash include strong financial privacy,
transactional efficiency, and non-physical presence. In the case of
nonpolitical value representation, such as gold or silver bullion, the macro
societal benefits of digital cash may also include protection from
depreciating fiat currencies, freedom from nation-state capital controls,
freedom from confiscation and tax levies, and the unimpeded ability to
transfer large-scale value privately.
